# PredItSpeechInt

The PredItSpeechInt (Predicting Italian Speech Intelligibility) project aims at developing an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system designed to work as a predictor of speech intelligibility in the presence of noise in the context of Matrix Sentence Tests With Closed Speech Corpora [1]. PredItSpeakInt is focused on the Italian language and its predicting capabilities are tested with previously performed Italian matrix sentence human-listening tests [2].
The ASR is based on the [Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit](http://kaldi-asr.org/) and it is trained by a 

1. * **HabeasCorpus** *
Closed Speech Corpora  , planning and speech acquisition.

2. * **Kaldi fork** *


This project is part of an ongoing collaboration between the ISOF-CNR Institute (I), the University of Ferrara (I) and the University of Bologna (I).
